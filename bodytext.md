1.

in anticipation of morning: airlessness, undone-ness -- to taste nothing

*resynchronization takes time*


2.

we wished a thickened glove to treat our splinting frame with noise


*a practice of gentle aversion: [...] to turn one’s attention to rarer and better things.*


3.

where do we greet our lesser heart in the whole who loved too hungry

*the partial, the shifting, the mutable — all that the absolute excludes.*

4.

the years yearn as badly as we do

*on cloudy days if plants are moved to constant light*


5.

patience not a game of lacquered feeling

*Detailed, urgent; once in a while, selfless.*
