LOUISE GLUCK, *The Seven Ages*

And there, at the end of the gaze,
a human being already entirely recognizable,
[…]
staring into the future with the combined
terror and hopelessness of a soul expecting annihilation.

[…]
Staring blindly ahead, the expression of someone staring into utter 
	darkness.
And thinking — which meant, I remember, the attempts of the mind
to prevent change.

[…]

All the defenses, the spiritual rigidity, the insistent
unmasking of the ordinary to reveal the tragic,
were actually innocence of the world.

Meaning the partial, the shifting, the mutable — 
all that the absolute excludes. I sat in the dark, in the living room.
The birthday was over. I was thinking, naturally, about time.
I remember how, in almost the same instant,
my heart would leap up exultant and collapse
in desolate anguish. The leaping up — the half I didn’t count —
that was happiness; that is what the word meant.

/

You will want the earth, then more of the earth
[…]
it will feed you, it will ravish you,
it will not keep you alive.

/

We had, each of us, a set of wishes.
The number changed. And what we wished — that changed also. Because
we had, all of us, such different dreams.

[…]

Waves of the mysterious wild hungers of youth, the dreams of childhood.
Detailed, urgent; once in a while, selfless.

[…]

We knew, and on dark nights, we acknowledged this.
How sweet the night became then,
once the wish released us,
how utterly silent.

//

In our youth our hearts were touched with fire.

MAGGIE NELSON, *The Art of Cruelty*

I don’t see 
the airlessness 
as the mark of 
any reprehensible 
shortcoming 

[…] 

but more likely 
that she died too 
young to explore 
the voluptuousness 

or complexity of her 
cruelty, much less to 
ventilate it.

/


The Neutral […] allows 
for a practice of gentle 
aversion: the right to reject 

the offered choices, to demur, 
to turn away, to turn one’s attention 
to rarer and better things.

/

for recoginizing and articulating pleasure

/

baffle the oppressive 
forces of reduction, 
generality, and dogmatism, 
they deserve to be called 
sweetness

/

…the intense dance 
between vulnerability 
and ruthlessness that 
begins when we are 

infants and persists, 
in its way, for the 
rest of our lives — 

our grappling with desires 
so fierce one fears that 
they might overwhelm or 
obliterate others, others

that we may desperately not 
want to lose — indeed, that 
we cannot afford to lose.

/ 

… given the ruthlessness of our desires, 
the fraught apprehension of our dependency, 
the heavy, chaotic experience of jealousy, 
and the radical undone-ness that can attend 
both loss and communion.

ANNE CARSON, *Decreation*

You know that sense of sinking through crust,
the low black *oh no* of the little room
with walls too close, so knowable.
